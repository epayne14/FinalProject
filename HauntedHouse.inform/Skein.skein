You got separated from your friends and older brother in a Haunted House Ride at the Local Theme Park. Unfortunately, the staff thought that the last of the guests had left, and all of the doors have been locked. Yet, all of the machines in the house are still strangely working. You fainted from fear at the last ghostly &quot;surprise,&quot; and you wake up in an unfamiliar room.

Haunted House of Hallucinations
An Interactive Fiction by Erika Payne Disable take all
Release 1 / Serial number 131007 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Black Room
The floor, ceiling, and walls are all black. A booming voice sounds from a speaker coming from the wall saying: &quot;How do you escape a room with NO WINDOWS, and NOOOO DOOORS. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA.&quot; The door you had just entered is behind you, of course, but it looks locked.

 Trying to calm yourself down, you notice a square section of the wall in front of you to the West is an off black color.

You can see a Second door, a Black door, and a Black Square here.

Victorian Living Room
Victorian furniture create a gloomy scene in this room, reminding you of a horror movie you watched about a murder in the 1800&quot;s. The fireplace lets off an ominous purple glow (obviously done with purple flashlights and the shifting of the light.) There is a large, comfy couch, a sitting chair, a bookcase, a large painting of a grim old man, and a knight in rusty armor holding an axe.


The Black Room is to the East, and there is a door to the West.

As you open the door letting off a horrifying creak, you see animatronic rats scurrying out of the corner of your eye. This doesn&apos;t bother you that much, until you see what is in the room. Large cages with robot animals that have fake foam oozing from their jowls. When you step close to one of the cages, a sensor goes off, and the animals leap against the wall of their cage, growling and chomping at you. It looks like one of the cages is unlocked…ﹱ

There is another podium at the entrance where a worker dressed as a ringmaster is supposed to welcome the guests.

Control Panel Room
An old man is fumbling around with one of the boxes on the wall, cutting wires and reconnecting others. He must be the electrician, maybe he can help you find a way out! This seems to be the Control Panel room that has all the wires and switches causing the electricity to work. Someone must have forgotten to switch off the ride, since lights are flashing next to the switches labeled:

 Lighting
 Fog
 Soundtracks


You should turn off the fog and soundtracks, but leave the lighting on so you can see.


The Staff Break Room is South.

You can see a Switch for Lighting, a Switch for Fog, a Switch for Soundtracks, a Boxes, and an Old Electrician here.

Exit
FREEEEDOM! You feel the fresh air blowing through your hair, the sunlight against your skin, and the smell of food coming from the vendors parked across the street. Eventually, you meet up with your friends, and tell them about your awful experiences.

 &quot;Weirdest part was when I was in the hall of mirrors. That little girl gave me the creeps for some reason.&quot;
 &quot;What little girl?&quot; your brother looks at you puzzlingly.
 &quot;Yeah, the little girl. Don&apos;t you remember? They have a soundtrack of a little girl giggling in the background, and they must do something with the mirrors so you see her running around, but you only see her hair and the ends of her dress. Freaky.&quot;
 &quot;Dude… there was no soundtrack or speakers in that room. It was just an empty Hall of Mirrors room. Maybe those Circus clowns just got to your head! Hahaha!nd&quot;

 As you and the group begin to walk away from the house, you can&apos;t help but notice a small plaque put in front of the Haunted House Ride.


-In Loving Memory of Sophia A. Harmon.  1897 - 1908. Resided on the property with her family, before the Harmon Family donated the estate to the theme park.-


Could it be…? Nah. Just your imagination…897

Victorian Living Room
Victorian furniture create a gloomy scene in this room, reminding you of a horror movie you watched about a murder in the 1800&quot;s. The fireplace lets off an ominous purple glow (obviously done with purple flashlights and the shifting of the light.) There is a large, comfy couch, a sitting chair, a bookcase, a large painting of a grim old man, and a knight in rusty armor holding an axe.


The Black Room is to the East, and there is a door to the West.

You can see a Black door, a Leather Couch, a Sitting Chair, a Bookcase, a Large Painting, a Knight in Rusty Armor, and a Fireplace here.

The floor, ceiling, and walls are all black. A booming voice sounds from a speaker coming from the wall saying: &quot;How do you escape a room with NO WINDOWS, and NOOOO DOOORS. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA.&quot; The door you had just entered is behind you, of course, but it looks locked.

 Trying to calm yourself down, you notice a square section of the wall in front of you to the West is an off black color.

Caged Rabid Animal Room
As you open the door letting off a horrifying creak, you see animatronic rats scurrying out of the corner of your eye. This doesn&apos;t bother you that much, until you see what is in the room. Large cages with robot animals that have fake foam oozing from their jowls. When you step close to one of the cages, a sensor goes off, and the animals leap against the wall of their cage, growling and chomping at you. It looks like one of the cages is unlocked…


The Living Room is in the East, and the Next Room is in the West.

Control Panel Room
An old man is fumbling around with one of the boxes on the wall, cutting wires and reconnecting others. He must be the electrician, maybe he can help you find a way out! This seems to be the Control Panel room that has all the wires and switches causing the electricity to work. Someone must have forgotten to switch off the ride, since lights are flashing next to the switches labeled:

 Lighting
 Fog
 Soundtracks


You should turn off the fog and soundtracks, but leave the lighting on so you can see.


The Staff Break Room is South.

You can see a Switch for Lighting, a Switch for Fog, a Switch for Soundtracks, a Boxes, and an Old Electrician here.
