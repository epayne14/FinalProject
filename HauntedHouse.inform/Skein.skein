You got separated from your friends and older brother in a Haunted House Ride at the Local Theme Park. Unfortunately, the staff thought that the last of the guests had left, and all of the doors have been locked. Yet, all of the machines in the house are still strangely working. You fainted from fear at the last ghostly &quot;surprise,&quot; and you wake up in an unfamiliar room.

Haunted House of Hallucinations
An Interactive Fiction by Erika Payne Disable take all
Release 1 / Serial number 131018 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Black Room
The floor, ceiling, and walls are all black. A booming voice sounds from a speaker coming from the wall saying: &quot;How do you escape a room with NO WINDOWS, and NOOOO DOOORS. HA. HA. HA. HA. HA.&quot;

 Trying to calm yourself down, you notice a square section of the wall in front of you is an off black color.

Victorian Living Room
Victorian furniture create a gloomy scene in this room, reminding you of a horror movie you watched about a murder in the 1800&quot;s. The fireplace lets off an ominous purple glow (obviously done with purple flashlights and the shifting of the light.)


There is a large, comfy couch, a sitting chair, a bookcase, a large painting of a grim old man, and a knight in rusty armor holding an axe.


The Black Room is to the East, and there is a door to the West.

Caged Rabid Animal Room
As you open the door letting off a horrifying creak, you see animatronic rats scurrying out of the corner of your eye. This doesn&apos;t bother you that much, until you see what is in the room. Large cages with robot animals that have fake foam oozing from their jowls. When you step close to one of the cages, a sensor goes off, and the animals leap against the wall of their cage, growling and chomping at you.


It looks like one of the cages is unlocked…愠楮

There is no repetitive music playing, but this time, you hear giggling that sounds like it&apos;s coming from a little girl. You feel like you can almost see a little girl darting between the mirrors, as if the lace of her dress and her long black hair trailing behind her disappears from every corner.

Graveyard Room
A large, very open room with the ceiling decorated to look like nighttime. The floor is littered with tombstones, but a large tombstone with a skeleton hugging the base of it really sticks out to you. The soundtrack to this room is howling wind and a wolf howling in the background.


The Circus Room is in the South. There is a door to the West that looks like it was decorated to not stand out. A door with a large mirror in the front is to the East. A room with what looks like fog coming out from under the door is to the North.

Control Panel Room
An old man is fumbling around with one of the boxes on the wall, cutting wires and reconnecting others. He must be the electrician, maybe he can help you find a way out! Try talking to him!!!

This seems to be the Control Panel room that has all the wires and buttons causing the electricity to work. Someone must have forgotten to switch off the ride, since lights are flashing next to the buttons labeled:

 Lighting
 Fog
 Soundtracks


You should press the fog and soundtracks buttons, but leave the lighting on so you can see.


The Staff Break Room is South.

You can see an old electrician here.

Victorian Living Room
Victorian furniture create a gloomy scene in this room, reminding you of a horror movie you watched about a murder in the 1800&quot;s. The fireplace lets off an ominous purple glow (obviously done with purple flashlights and the shifting of the light.) There is a large, comfy couch, a sitting chair, a bookcase, a large painting of a grim old man, and a knight in rusty armor holding an axe.


The Black Room is to the East, and there is a door to the West.

Caged Rabid Animal Room
As you open the door letting off a horrifying creak, you see animatronic rats scurrying out of the corner of your eye. This doesn&apos;t bother you that much, until you see what is in the room. Large cages with robot animals that have fake foam oozing from their jowls. When you step close to one of the cages, a sensor goes off, and the animals leap against the wall of their cage, growling and chomping at you.


It looks like one of the cages is unlocked…愠楮

Great. A room devoted to the Circus. You&apos;ve always hated the Circus, especially clowns.

Exit
FREEEEDOM! You feel the fresh air blowing through your hair, the sunlight against your skin, and the smell of food coming from the vendors parked across the street. Eventually, you meet up with your friends, and tell them about your awful experiences.

 &quot;Weirdest part was when I was in the hall of mirrors. That little girl gave me the creeps for some reason.&quot;
 &quot;What little girl?&quot; your brother looks at you puzzlingly.
 &quot;Yeah, the little girl. Don&apos;t you remember? They have a soundtrack of a little girl giggling in the background, and they must do something with the mirrors so you see her running around, but you only see her hair and the ends of her dress. Freaky.&quot;
 &quot;Dude… there was no soundtrack or speakers in that room. It was just an empty Hall of Mirrors room. Maybe those Circus clowns just got to your head! Hahaha!nd&quot;

 As you and the group begin to walk away from the house, you can&apos;t help but notice a small plaque put in front of the Haunted House Ride.


-In Loving Memory of Sophia A. Harmon.  1897 - 1908. Resided on the property with her family, before the Harmon Family donated the estate to the theme park.-

&quot;Thanks a bunch kid! Here&apos;s the key that leads out of the Meat Locker. After the Narrow Hallway, you should be home free to the exit! Just leave the key for me though on the ground in the butcher room so I can get out too.&quot;

As you open the door letting off a horrifying creak, you see animatronic rats scurrying out of the corner of your eye. This doesn&apos;t bother you that much, until you see what is in the room. Large cages with robot animals that have fake foam oozing from their jowls. When you step close to one of the cages, a sensor goes off, and the animals leap against the wall of their cage, growling and chomping at you.


It looks like one of the cages is unlocked…

&quot;Thanks a bunch kid! Here&apos;s the key that leads out of the Meat Locker. After the Narrow Hallway, you should be home free to the exit! Just leave the key for me though on the ground in the butcher room so I can get out too.&quot;

Staff Break Room
FINALLY. A soundproof room with nothing scary in it. This is obviously a break room for the staff during their downtime. There&apos;s a mini fridge, an old TV, an old couch, and a desk.


The entrance to the Graveyard is to the East, and there is a metal door to the North.

Graveyard Room
A large, very open room with the ceiling decorated to look like nighttime. The floor is littered with tombstones, but a large tombstone with a skeleton hugging the base of it really sticks out to you. The soundtrack to this room is howling wind and a wolf howling in the background.


The Circus Room is in the South. There is a door to the West that looks like it was decorated to not stand out. A door with a large mirror in the front is to the East. A room with what looks like fog coming out from under the door is to the North.

Meat Locker
Large sacks of what looks like cow meat hang from the ceiling on metal hooks. Obviously, their plastic, but it still gives you the creeps being wrapped in the cloudy plastic. Usually, a worker dawning a butcher&apos;s outfit chases the visitors around towards the exit, but the fog is so thick, you can&apos;t see it.

 The Graveyard is South. There is a large cobwebbed door to the East.

Exit
FREEEEDOM! You feel the fresh air blowing through your hair, the sunlight against your skin, and the smell of food coming from the vendors parked across the street. Eventually, you meet up with your friends, and tell them about your awful experiences.

 &quot;Weirdest part was when I was in the hall of mirrors. That little girl gave me the creeps for some reason.&quot;
 &quot;What little girl?&quot; your brother looks at you puzzlingly.
 &quot;Yeah, the little girl. Don&apos;t you remember? They have a soundtrack of a little girl giggling in the background, and they must do something with the mirrors so you see her running around, but you only see her hair and the ends of her dress. Freaky.&quot;
 &quot;Dude… there was no soundtrack or speakers in that room. It was just an empty Hall of Mirrors room. Maybe those Circus clowns just got to your head! Hahaha!nd&quot;

 As you and the group begin to walk away from the house, you can&apos;t help but notice a small plaque put in front of the Haunted House Ride.


-In Loving Memory of Sophia A. Harmon.  1897 - 1908. Resided on the property with her family, before the Harmon Family donated the estate to the theme park.-


Could it be…? Nah. Just your imagination…897

Narrow Hall of Terror
Finally you can see! You see a long, narrow hallway before you, filled with cobwebs and ghosts popping from the ceiling. A couple of robotic hands sticking out from the walls look like they&apos;re trying to grab you.

 The Meat Locker is West, but you see a Black Door to the East. Could this be the exit?.

Victorian Living Room
Victorian furniture create a gloomy scene in this room, reminding you of a horror movie you watched about a murder in the 1800&quot;s. The fireplace lets off an ominous purple glow (obviously done with purple flashlights and the shifting of the light.)


There is a large, comfy couch, a sitting chair, a bookcase, a large painting of a grim old man, and a knight in rusty armor holding an axe.


The Black Room is to the East, and there is a door to the West.

As you open the door letting off a horrifying creak, you see animatronic rats scurrying out of the corner of your eye. This doesn&apos;t bother you that much, until you see what is in the room. Large cages with robot animals that have fake foam oozing from their jowls. When you step close to one of the cages, a sensor goes off, and the animals leap against the wall of their cage, growling and chomping at you.


It looks like one of the cages is unlocked…愠楮

Great. A room devoted to the Circus. You&apos;ve always hated the Circus, especially clowns. Large robotic clowns loom over you and a demonic low-voiced laughter rings through the room as a waltzing, repetitive circus song plays in the background. There is another podium at the entrance where a worker dressed as a ringmaster is supposed to welcome the guests.
